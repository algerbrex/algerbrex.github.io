Blunder Wins Its First Tournament!
----------------------------------

Over the past couple of weeks, Graham Banks (a long time respected tester and member of the chess programming community for those of 
you who may not know) held a tournament, dubbed [Gandalf and the Spinning Blade](http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=80228). 
Here Blunder was pittied against a slate of many other very strong engines, including part of the namesake of the tournament title,
[Gandalf](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Gandalf), an older commerical chess engine.

After a hard fought battle for first, Blunder managed to come out on top and win its first tournament! Scoring 2.5 points ahead of CM9000
and Gandalf, the runners up:

```
27.5 - Blunder 8.0.0 64-bit
25.0 - CM9000 Enforcer
25.0 - Gandalf 7 64-bit
23.5 - Drosophila 1.6 64-bit
23.0 - Zevra 2.5 64-bit
22.5 - MadChess 3.0 64-bit
21.0 - Rotor 0.8
21.0 - Nebula 2.0 64-bit
20.5 - Lozza 2.3 64-bit
19.5 - Philou 3.7.1 64-bit
19.0 - Raven 1.20 64-bit
16.5 - Leorik 2.1 64-bit
```

What I found funny was towards the end of the tournament, Blunder put itself in a position to win by just playing safe. If it drew the
last three games, it guaranteed itself a win, regardless of what second place did. And Blunder did just that, drawing its last three games,
one of them quite quickly. 

I was worried Blunder would push too hard for a win in the last three games and let the front spot slip away, but Blunder seemed to bee-line
for a draw in all three games, almost as if it had the awarness of a human player and knew all it had to do was play it safe. Either that
or Blunder's too drawish, but I prefer the former explanation :-)
