## Blunder 7.5.0 Released

Blunder 7.5.0 has been released! Most of the changes mentioned in a previous [progress report]() were added to this release, and they represent about a 30 Elo increase in strength
over Blunder 7.4.0. I've also cleaned up some other small parts of the repository, hopefully making everything more friendly for visitors.

This latest version is currently participating in it's [first tournament](http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=78968), and a modified version is participating in 
[another tournament](http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=78903), though whith much stronger engines! It does have one very nice positional win versus 
[Colossus 2021b](http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?p=915818#p915818) though.

To download the latest version of Blunder, visit the [releases page](https://github.com/algerbrex/blunder/releases) on it's github repository.
