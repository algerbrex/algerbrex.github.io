Welcome to my blog about Blunder, a [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface) compatible chess engine written in Golang. I started working on this project towards the end of 2020, when I was stuck inside, quarentined, and needed a hobby to
keep me busy. Currently Blunder's rated [2624 Elo on the CCRL](http://ccrl.chessdom.com/ccrl/4040/cgi/engine_details.cgi?print=Details&each_game=1&eng=Blunder%207.6.0%2064-bit#Blunder_7_6_0_64-bit). If you'd like to try
Blunder for yourself, you can download the latest releases from [here](https://github.com/algerbrex/blunder/releases),
or visit its [lichess profile](https://lichess.org/@/blunder_engine/all), where it's occasionally online. The source
code is also [publically available](https://github.com/algerbrex/blunder), if you're interested in that as well. Thanks for stopping by!
